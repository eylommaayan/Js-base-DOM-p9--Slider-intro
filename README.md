Selecting Elements: The code selects all elements with the class slide and assigns them to the slides variable. It also selects the next and previous buttons and assigns them to the nextBtn and prevBtn variables, respectively.

Setting Initial Positions: It loops through each slide and sets its initial position using CSS left property, ensuring each slide is displayed side by side.

Event Listeners: Event listeners are added to the next and previous buttons. When clicked, they increment or decrement the counter variable and call the carousel() function.

Carousel Function: The carousel() function handles the transition between slides. It adjusts the position of the slides based on the current value of the counter. Additionally, it controls the display of the next and previous buttons based on the current slide.

Button Display: Initially, the previous button is hidden (display: none) because there are no previous slides. The display of the next button is controlled dynamically based on the current slide.
